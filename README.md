SH101 Disassembled

I bought a used SH101 when I was in college, and took it apart a few years ago to replace its aging electrolytic caps.

While I was in there, I noticed that it is built around an 80C49, an early microcontroller.

I desoldered it and was happy to discover that my old Data I/O 2900 could dump the code inside.

Over the years I've studied and added comments to the code. It's pretty neat.
